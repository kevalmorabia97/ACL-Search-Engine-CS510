Named Entity Recognition With Bidirectional Lstm-Cnns named entity recognition is a challenging task that has traditionally required large amounts of knowledge in the form of feature engineering and lexicons to achieve high performance. In this paper we present a novel neural network architecture that automatically detects word-and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional lstm and CNN architecture  eliminating the need for most feature engineering. We also propose a novel method of encoding partial lexicon matches in neu-ral networks and compare it to existing approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that given only tokenized text and publicly available word embeddings our system is competitive on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and surpasses the previously reported state of the art performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset by 2.13 F1 points. By using two lexicons constructed from publicly-available sources we establish new state of the art performance with an F1 score of 91.62 on CoNLL-2003 and 86.28 on OntoNotes surpassing systems that employ heavy feature engineering proprietary lexicons and rich entity linking information.,4642,-1
